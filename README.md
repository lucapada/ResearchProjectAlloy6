# Development of a Teaching Module on Alloy 6

## Abstract
As software systems have become increasingly important, teaching Software Engineering students how to develop high-quality software is essential. In particular, one of the main goals of software engineers is verifying that developed software meets specific requirements. In this regard, a precise and simple modeling language like Alloy can be useful, especially with its temporal features introduced in the sixth version. Nonetheless, such languages concern students due to their abstract concepts, therefore a comprehensive and effective teaching method is pivotal for them. Accordingly, we present our work on a teaching module for Alloy 6 that promotes an active learning environment leading to specific learning goals with the aid of multimedia.
